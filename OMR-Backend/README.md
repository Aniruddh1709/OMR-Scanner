# OMR-Backend



The views are to be written in app/crud_view/resources/controllers.py.

You might want to create a virtual environment and install all the packages using pip install requirements.txt.

I had created a student model earlier if it's not required that's fine you can change the code appropriately.

To run the app simply do python run.py in the main folder.
